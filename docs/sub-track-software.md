# Track: Software Development

These are the subjects that will appear in Semester 3, 4, 5 and 6 if you choose to want to specialize in Software Development.

## Web Design Technologies

**TPR:** 30/70

You will be spending mostly on designing websites. Starting with HTML (Layouts), CSS - (Styling), then JavaScript (Dynamic web)

If you're good in visualizing layouts, or imagining how the output will look like, this course should not be hard for you.

During web design, you will be writing A LOT of HTML Tags, I highly recommend learning [emmet](https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/) as well to help quicken the process. VSCode & WebStorm has this feature out of the box.

You might also stumble upon [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). jQuery is a library to help you write JavaScript, meaning you have another way to write JS. Meanwhile, Bootstrap is a CSS framework where it has predefined styles for you to use.

### Software Required

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - After installing VSCode, you will also need to install these extensions:
    - [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode). This formats your code to keep code cleaner & more consistent. Usage is found inside the page as well.
    - [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer). This opens up a local server of the current file you've opened. Usage is also found inside the page.
- (Paid, free for Students) [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)
- (Optional) [Figma](https://figma.com/) - Used to plan & design your website, aka UI/UX Design

## Advanced Web Development (AWD)

**TPR:** 30/70

### Software Required

- [Netbeans 8 or above](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html) - This is different from [IPT's software requirement](/docs/sub-track-software?id=software-required-6), if IPT's version works, then use that one.

## Human Computer Interaction (HCI)

**TPR:** 100/0

This subject involves around understanding User Experience (UX) ranging from a simple button to a keyboard.

A great example is a computer mouse. A mouse is shaped like an egg because of ergonomics so that it's easier and comfortable to use.

## Secure Mobile Computing (SMC)

**TPR:** 100/0

This subject is essentially a little brother of [Security Basics & IT Professional](/docs/sub-foundations?id=security-basics-and-it-professional). From here, you're basically learning about security in mobile phones.

You will also be doing quite a number of reports.

A sibling of [Visual Programming](/docs/sub-track-software?id=visual-programming), but a bit harder. Because you will be programming in Java and won't be able to visualize it in the early chapters of this course, for the sake of learning.

### Software Required

- [NetBeans with Java SE 8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-netbeans-jsp-3413139-esa.html) - NetBean is a bit stubborn with later versions of Java, so stick with this one to make things easier.
