# Internship

Known as LI (Latihan Industri) in the campus. This is the _very_ last thing you need to go through before you actually graduate.

Anything about being an intern is very self-explanatory. From getting employed, writing reports daily, to the last day of work.

Internship **does not** accumulate into your CGPA. Though this "subject" will use it as to grade your work performance.

## Before

### Part 1

#### "Subject" Application

You will be briefed about how to apply into this "subject" before you look for a position.

Usually, they will ask and guide you how to apply through [SPMP](http://spmp.pbu.edu.my/).

Here's a short guide if you want to apply:

1. Go to [SPMP](http://spmp.pbu.edu.my/) and login with your account.
2. Click: Latihan Industri > Versi Baharu > Daftar Untuk Menjalani LI > Daftar / Status Untuk Menjalani Latihan Industri > Permohonan Baharu
3. Follow the instructions given
4. Once done, you should see the current session and have applied for it. It should show something like "Status Memohon: Telah Memohon"

Once completed, you will also need to get these files from their site ([PBU - UPLI](http://pbuupli.yolasite.com/)):

- Borang Pendaftaran Modul UPLI
- Borang Lepas Tanggung
- Resume template (Bahasa/English)

Then fill all of them where appropriate.

Once filled, give it to your PA and he will handle the rest for you.

?> The PA might ask you to sign it with Head of Department (aka KJ). Check with them first.

#### Getting a job

Right after the briefing, you can start looking for a job/position nearest to your home. The deadline will be given by them.

You can look for your friends or parents for a job. Alternatively, there will be a list of companies that you can contact [in their site](http://pbuupli.yolasite.com).

!> The job must relate to IT.

You may then use the template and the cover letter provided by them to apply for it.

Once your position is confirmed, you must send a response letter to confirm that you got the position to LI. The company can either fax to them with the number provided, or return to you to send it to them either email or through WhatsApp.

!> If they do not fill the form, LI considers that you have failed to get a job and you have to wait until the next session (next semester).

### Part 2

You will be briefed again 1-2 weeks before you start working. From here, they will brief you about how to write a daily report/reflection journal, preparing a final report, and re-confirming your position.

?> If you start working earlier then the date specified by LI, these do not apply until the start working date specified.

Again, in their site, you need to grab 3 documents:

- Kad Pengesahan Lapor Diri (Reporting Card)
- Reflection Journal/Daily Report
  - Daily - Minimum contents:
    - Date & Time
    - Place/Venue
    - Tasks
    - Optionals: Challenges, Solutions, Problems, Sketches
  - Weekly - Minimum contents:
    - Week Number #
    - Weekly summary
    - Skills gained
- Final Report
  - You have to make this one your own, as they do not provide a template except table of contents.

You can then start preparing the templates for you to fill in when working.

?> Examples can be found [below](/docs/intern?id=examples).

## During

On the first day, you need to get the company sign your reporting card and send it to LI by hand or post/_pos laju_.

?> As of COVID-19, emailing to LI is now an option.

!> You must send it within 2 weeks, or else LI considers that you failed internship.

Every day, you have to write what you've done into Reflection Journal. On the end of the week, summarize what you've done in 1 paragraph into the same journal.

It is not necessary to fill in everything daily, as long you filled something in "Tasks", it is good enough. Meanwhile, you can start working on your final report.

?> All documents can be written in either English or Bahasa, but cannot be mixed/Dwibahasa.

## After

On the last week of your work, prepare a letter of termination provided by PBU - UPLI and your final report.

?> This area is a stub, if you have completed LI, do [open an issue](https://github.com/reverk/surviving-in-pbu/issues/new) and start discussing!

## Examples

Got stuck and have no idea what to do? Here are a few that will (hopefully) help you!

### Journal Reflection/Daily Report

- [Sample](http://pbuupli.yolasite.com/resources/2014.1-contoh-penulisan-jurnal-refleksi.pdf)
  - More practical example are on page 3, first one.
  - While you can write as much as on page 2, it's nearly impossible to write it every day. Therefore, writing the tasks is enough.
- [Template](http://pbuupli.yolasite.com/resources/TEMPLATE%20LAPORAN%20HARIAN%20%26%20LAPORAN%20MINGGUAN.pdf)
  - Again, writing tasks is enough.
  - The report can be in either English or Bahasa.

### Final Report
