# Hostel

For newcomers, you are required to stay in the hostel for the first semester. The following semesters is optional, though highly recommended to stay inside for the entire course.

If you want to stay in hostel for the next semester, you'll have to reapply similar to how you do it on your first day in campus.

If you want to stay outside of campus, be warned that you will bear the costs of rent and utility bills at the cost of freedom.

?> If you live outside, gather your coursemates to split the bills.

## Packing & Luggage

It is highly advised that you should pack minimally because you will be moving out on the end of the semesters. The reason they do is is because they need to rearrange rooms for the next newcomers. For instance, every new students will always stay in the first floor.

What we recommend is:

- A few sets of cloths -- 4-6 sets will do.
- Personal care (soap, shampoo, etc.)
- 2 sets of bed sheets
- A small bottle of detergent -- you will most likely end up handwash your clothes
- A bucket to keep your used clothes
- Home care tools (broom, mop, etc.)
- Cloth hangers depending on your cloths & for drying
- Optionals
  - Printers -- You'll need to pay for "licencing fees"
  - Extension ports -- not more than or equal to 3 ports
  - Sports gear -- this one is up to you

## Environment

On arrival, you will have:

- A room for two (you and your new friend)
  - Contains 2 sets of bed without bed sheets, table & chair and cabinet
  - Others: Celling fan, window.
- A public bathroom & toilet with closed doors
- A public pantry
- A public water dispenser (hot & cold water included)

There won't be any premiums like elevators and air-cons. The air-cons are for decoration. ðŸ˜›

## Rules

On arrival, you will have a list of rules (that is worth 2 pages long filled with text) that you need to obey. Otherwise you risk getting kicked out.

To put simply: Don't be an idiot and respect each other's privacy.

Here are the key points that you need to know:

- Use a 3 port extension and you're ðŸ‘Œ
- Don't use any high-current stuffs or you risk tripping the entire floor's electricity.

!> Cooking is literally out of the question here.

- But if you need water kettle or iron, you can lend it from the hostel office.
- Instant Noodles & Snacks are allowed -- because there's a public water dispenser/water kettle after all.
- On 12 am, avoid making noises -- others need some privacy, peace & quiet.
- Whatever you do, keep the hostel environment clean. For example, if you've done cooking instant noodles in the public pantry, clean up opened packets and pick up loose noodles and throw it into the trash.

### Curfew

Hostels has a defined time for you to go outside.

| Day                          | Time               |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Weekdays (Monday - Friday)   | 8:00 am - 7:00 pm  |
| Weekends (Saturday - Sunday) | 8:00 am - 10:00 pm |

?> On Friday, it might end 10:00 pm as well.

On 10:00 pm, guards will confiscate your Student Card. If you want it back, you'll have to pay a fine (RM 50 for the first time, [more info here](/docs/fines)) to the warden.

!> Losing Student Card would also mean that you cannot attend classes.

Curfew will not apply if it's:

- Semester break
- Mid-semester break
- Public Holidays
- An approved letter that you will be returning late to Hostel

## Returning Home

Living in Hostel will surely take some time to get used to it. And sometimes you want a getaway from all these. Thankfully, the Hostel has provided an option to go back. However, you'll have to get approved before you can actually go back.

Here are the procedures:

### On Weekends

Going back home on weekends are guaranteed to approve _unless_ there is an event on weekend. If the weekend's event is mandatory, then you're out of luck.

You can apply to go home on Friday until Sunday.

1. Hit up at [SPMP](http://spmp.pbu.edu.my/), and register for a form to return home.
2. Print out the form.
3. Fill in the form. Usually it's the time to leave & time to reach campus.
   - Writing 8 am - 10 am is fine, as you can leave anytime as long it's on the day you specified.
4. Get Warden-in-charge signed.
   - Wardens will usually be in the Hostel Office at Wednesday to Friday night.
   - They will be also on Saturday morning till noon.
5. When the day comes, pack up and head to the guardhouse and hand over the signed form.
6. Return home!

When you come back, head to the guardhouse and remove the form from their file.

### On Weekdays

If you have a valid reason to return home early such as sickness, family issues or maybe driving lessons, then you can go back.

1. Write a letter to Head of IT Department to address that you will not be attending classes on that/these day(s).

?> Looking for a template? [Here you go!](https://github.com/reverk/surviving-in-pbu/tree/main/assets/Letter_to_go_home_early_template.docx)

2. Print it out, then get your PA (Academic Advisor) signed.
3. Then get another sign from the Head of IT Department on the same letter.
4. Make a copy or 2 for the guardhouse, and another for yourself.
5. Inform Hostel Office that you will be leaving on the date you specified.
6. From here, follow the procedures as if you're [leaving for weekend](/docs/hostel?id=on-weekends).

!> Doing so will mark your class attendance as absent, so use it wisely. (Except you're sick, then you can [get an exemption](/docs/advices-general?id=sick).)

?> If you do NOT have any classes on that day, either partially or the entire day, it's safe to do so without costing you anything other than time & effort to apply. <br><br> Also, it's not worth doing it on Friday when you're about to go home.

## Roll Call

A roll call is basically an event where you must assemble in front of Hostel Office. From there, they will do attendance checks to see if anyone is still outside campus.

It will usually occur 0 to 1 times per semester and happens usually 10 pm onwards.

## Spot Checks

Spot checks are times when they do random checks on your room to see if you're bringing stuffs you should not bring.

This occurs 0 to 1 times per semester and usually 10 pm onwards as well.

?> Roll Calls and Spot Checks are always random, so there's no accurate answers. <br><br> Even if there is, that totally ruins the surprise factor, isn't it?
