# Final Year Project

You will take this "subject" on the last semester before you start internship. This will apply whatever you've learned throughout the course into a real project.

FYP can be done individually (not recommended), or groups of 3. Members can be anyone within your batch regardless of track.

A project **must** be either practical, or something that you can learn.

Examples of project include:

- Blog page
- Portable server
- Biometric Attendance System
- Augmented Reality
- Or anything that's very new

?> If you plan to do this early, be sure to find a client first or you risk getting rejected. But we'd still recommend until this comes.

## Before

You will be briefed what FYP is about before you start, or somewhere in Week 1-2. Then, a list of available supervisors will be given to you to let you choose & secure them.

!> Be quick: Choosing a supervisor is very competitive. Let the supervisors know in advance if you want them to take you.

After that, a list of documents will be shared to you. These include:

- Poster examples
- Logbook
- Project Guideline
- FYP Letter (for external client use only)
- FYP registration letter
- List of available supervisors

?> Don't worry, these will be covered in the During section.

You will then need to print out logbook according to the weeks. If you are on a regular/long semester, print out up to 15 weeks. If you're in a short semester, print out up to 8 weeks.

From here, you can pick your approach:

- Find a client first to accept your idea, then discuss with supervisor
- Discuss with your supervisor first to help you find a suitable client, or a better idea

After that, prepare a proposal presentation about the idea. More info can be found inside Project Guidelines.

## During

Assuming it's Week 3-4 of your final year project, you should already started planning and designing a poster.

You will also start doing the actual project during this time.

During these weeks, you will also do 2 demos in front of your supervisor and an accessor to check on your progress.

?> More info can be found inside Project Guideline provided by the person-in-charge.

### Logbook

A logbook will simply log your weekly works. They're used for mark your attendance as supervisors have to sign it every week.

?> As of COVID-19, the workflow may vary. Do confirm with your lecturer.

### Final Report/Documentation

A final report should be working alongside with the project. Some parts can be done without the product completed first while some have to as it requires screenshots or images of your product. 

Contents can be found inside Project Guideline.

### Posters

As of pre-COVID, the posters are used for competition presentation. The posters also have to be printed out in A1 size.

As of COVID, there's nothing in use at the moment.

Examples of the poster should be given by person-in-charge.

### FYP Letter & Registration Letter

The FYP Registration Letter is used to register your project.

Meanwhile, if you have a client **outside** of the campus, another FYP letter has to be filled & signed by the client.

## After

This assumes that you're on the last week of FYP (W15 for regular sem, W8 for short sem).

From here, you will do the final presentation in front of supervisor, accessor and sometimes your client. 

A final report should also be ready to be submitted.

Once finish presented, and once the results are okay. Then you're ready for [Internship](/docs/intern.md).
