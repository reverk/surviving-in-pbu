# "I got accepted! now what?"

First of all, congratulations on getting approved to study in PBU! ðŸŽ‰ Second of all, you will need to start preparing a bunch of documents as per requirement. Every year, they might change the required documents. So check into [HEP PBU](https://heppbu.com/)'s website and look for "New Students"/"Pelajar Baharu".

With all that in mind, below are the other things that you should know.

You might also want to check out our [advises](/docs/advices-general.md).

## PC Requirements

Since this is an IT course, you may need to check our (senior's) recommended PC requirements in order to work fast and efficiently.

As of COVID-19, you may need to install videoconferencing apps to have classes remotely. The services they use are:

- Google Meet
- Microsoft Teams
- Zoom
- Cisco Webex (mostly only for events)

?> **Note**: Check with your lecturer to see what they want to use.

Other softwares will be listed per-subject basis. If you want a quick summary, [here you go](/docs/softwares)!
