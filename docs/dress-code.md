# Dress Code

As of COVID-19, dress code hardly applies if you're not in campus. But here they are if COVID ends.

## Classes

- Guys ðŸ‘¦: Buttoned top, black pants and sneakers is fine. Remember to tuck in your shirt as well.
- Girls ðŸ‘§: Again, buttoned top, black pants and sneakers. You can also wear dress that is long until it covers the knee. Or you can wear something like *baju kurung*.
- Basically, dress appropriately, as if you're going to work.

!> As of 2020, Polo Ts are not allowed and students are required to wear white buttoned tops every Monday.

## Casuals/Sports/Outside Learning Hours

- Guys ðŸ‘¦ & Girls ðŸ‘§: Basic Tee, long pants regardless of color, slippers/sneakers.
- If you're in hostel, wearing short pants is okay. As long you don't wear it in front of wardens.

!> Jeans, tight, or translucent (partially transparent) clothings are not allowed, regardless of in or outside of learning hours.
