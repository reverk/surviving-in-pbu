# Advices

Here are some tips that will help you while surviving in this campus. Maybe helpful in the long run too.

## General

- Be punctual. You can't go wrong with that.
- Ask if you have doubt, even if it's a stupid question.
- Assignments can be given at any time, usually within 1 week before the deadline. Worst case scenario is days before deadline. So be quick to hands and well prepared!
- If you have a lot of assignments, do prioritize the ones that are harder, or near to the deadline, or whichever is first.
- Attendance contribute to your GPA per subject.
- In the first semester, get as much connections as you can as possible. This is because you can pick who to stick with when it comes to group/pair assignments.
- Speaking of group/pair assignments, always distribute the workload to the people who can do it. Alternatively, you can let them choose what to do, but always remember everyone should have the equal amount of work.
- If you are the group leader, expect them to hand in late. A workaround is to remind them or tell them "I'd like to have this in X days".
- If you are the group member, voice out your thoughts/concerns/issues to contribute to the group. Remember: No one knows until you voice out!
- It is discouraged to sit 1-on-1 with guys and girl. But if it's in groups, it's fine.
- Your Academic Advisor (known as PA) will be stuck with you until you graduate.

?> Think PA as your friend. If you have any doubts, you can ask them politely.
