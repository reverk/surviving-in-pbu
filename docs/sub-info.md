# Important Info

Before you get into all available subjects that Balik Pulau Polytechnic has, there are a few things to take note of:

## Language Taught

All subjects will be taught in mixed Bahasa and English.

## Assignment Types

All subjects has some of these assignment types, if not all:

| Name                                                  | Description                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Quiz                                                  | Quizzes that contain around 10 questions, 90% of the time will always be objective.                                 |
| Lab Exercise/Lab Activity                             | Mostly occur on subjects that involves practical works, such as coding or media creation.                           |
| Lab Task/Practical Task                               | These assignments may or may not contribute GPA to the subject.                                                     |
| Problem Based Task (PBT)/Problem Based Exercise (PBE) | This are slightly difficult assignments as they involve critical thinking. They also contribute GPA to the subject. |
| Project                                               | Self explanatory. This assignment will put whatever you've learned into a single project.                           |

## Attendance

All subjects require you to attend classes at least 80% of the time. They also contribute to the GPA of the subject.

If you happen to be sick, provide a MC to let lecturers mark your attendance to be sick-absent.

?> There is a procedure to properly hand over your MC. [More details here.](/docs/advices-general?id=sick)

If you do not attend classes of the subject for 4 accumulated hours, the lecturer will issue a warning letter to remind you to be in class.

Failing to attend classes at all will result in failing that subject. Therefore causing you to retake the subject in the next semester.

### Absent in class

If you happen to not attend to classes, here are a number of scenarios that you may find it helpful:

?> As of COVID-19, this is written as if you're in campus. If you happen to be studying remotely, contact your PA for more info.

#### Sick

You'll first need to have a MC to certify that you're sick on that day. Then do the following steps:

1. Get a piece of A4 paper and glue your MC on top.
2. Make copies (either B&W or Colored) depending on how many classes you missed. For example, if you missed PF and ICS, you will need to make 2 and 1 more for yourself.
3. Hand it over to PA, so he can sign & chop it to verify.
4. Hand over copies to your lecturers via either to their pigeon holes, in class, or personally.

?> You need to make copies earlier as your PA will keep the original MC for future reference.

#### Event/Conference Conflict

If you have events such as a workshop, event, or a conference that collides with your class. Inform your lecturer that conflicts with your subject early.

Bonus points if you have a letter of exception (or similar) to hand over.

#### Class Crash

If you have other classes conflicting with your current class, discuss with your current lecturer to help you allocate to another time.

?> This only occurs if you have previously failed a subject.

## GPA of Subject

Most subjects typically has Assignments & Project/Exam as well as Attendance to accumulate your GPA. To date, there's no format to calculate all of them.

However, the minimum marks to pass a subject goes like this:

### Final Assessment (FA) Subjects

| Name | Minimum Marks |
| ---- | ------------- |
| PB   | 40%           |

Key Notes:<br>
_Penilaian Berterusan_ = PB (Quiz + Lab/Practical Task + PBT/PBE + Project)

### Final Exam (FE) Subjects

| Name | Minimum Marks |
| ---- | ------------- |
| PB   | 40%           |
| PA   | 40%           |

Key Notes:<br>
_Penilaian Berterusan_ = PB (Quiz + Lab/Practical Task + PBT/PBE + Project)<br>
_Peperiksaan Akhir_ = PA (Final Exam)

?> Having less than 40% on either PB or PA will result in failing the subject.

## Subject format

There is a defined format to better understand the subject's details.

### Format Template

```markdown
## Subject Name

### Description

**Theory/Practical Ratio** (%) (referred as TPR)

### Software Required

### Resources
```

?> More info about TPR [here](/docs/sub-info?id=theory-practical-ratio-tpr).

### Subject Format Example

```markdown
## Introduction to Computer System (ICS)

### Description

**TPR:** 90/10

Involves understanding of PC components, such as CPU, GPU, types of storage, as well as mouse & keyboard.

Practical stuffs may include PC building and installing an OS via a VM.

### Software Required

- (Optional until required) VirtualBox
  - Unless theres VirtualBox included in the lab, use that one.
  - Only used for installing an OC via a Virtual Machine (VM).

```

## Theory Practical Ratio (TPR)

Theory Practical Ratio (TPR) is defined as how much theory and practical stuffs you will face throughout the entire subject.

What counts as Theory:

- A lecture that needs to remember things (ex. a formula)

What counts as Practical:

- Something that you need to get off the chair (ex. building a PC)
- Coding or Programming (ex. writing C++)

### TPR Examples

| A subject that...                                                                           | TPR            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Needs you to remember a lot of things, only to split it out on exams or reports/assignments | 100/0          |
| Needs you to write code, but has a few briefing on how to use the syntax                    | 70/30 or 80/20 |
| Does _just_ sports                                                                          | 0/100          |
| Does sports with a few tutorials/how-tos                                                    | 10/90 or 20/80 |
| Needs you to calculate stuffs                                                               | 70/30 or 80/20 |
