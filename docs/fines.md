# Fines / _Samans_

If you happen to break a rule and end up being slapped with a fine, this is the place for you.

For first-timers, the fine will always land at RM 50. Consecutive offenders will slap with a heavier fine.

Common rules that students will (intentionally or unintentionally) break are:

- Coming over [curfew](/docs/hostel?id=curfew) times
- Breaking [dress codes](/docs/dress-code/)
- Bringing items that are not allowed into hostel

## To Pay Fines

Simply head to the Student Welfare Department (aka Hal Whwal Pelajar, HEP) with your fine and cash ready. Then pay it over the counter.

## Not Paying Fines

If you do not pay your fines, you will not be able to see your results at the end of the semester. This will lead to a series of issues:

- Not having the results mean you do not know if you've failed a subject
- If you failed one, you do not know and not aware of what to do
- You cannot apply for the next semester, as it is required to have it

So we recommend to pay up as soon as possible.

## Appeals

If you happen to see the fine as "too much", you can ask for an appeal by writing a letter to HEP. Then submit it by hand.

For first timers, it's likeky that they can reduce fines from RM 50 to RM 35.

?> The letter template is found outside the entrance of HEP. If you have a template, please do open an issue to ease other students.
